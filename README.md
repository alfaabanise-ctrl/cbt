# CBT desktop and Android app

## Build the Android app

The Tauri app can be packaged for Android phones as an APK. Install Android
Studio with its Android SDK and NDK, and install a supported JDK before building.
Set `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) and `JAVA_HOME` in your environment,
then open a new terminal in this project:

```powershell
npm install
npm run android:init
npm run android:apk
```

The generated APK is under `src-tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/apk`.
For Google Play, build an Android App Bundle instead:

```powershell
npm run android:aab
```

To run the app on a connected Android device during development, enable USB
debugging and run:

```powershell
npm run android:dev
```

The app keeps its SQLite databases and activation state in the app's private
storage. Bundled database files are copied there on first launch; existing
user databases are not overwritten. Android assigns a persistent installation
ID for activation. Reinstalling the app may create a new ID.

## Web development
